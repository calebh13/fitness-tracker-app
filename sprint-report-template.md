# Sprint 1 Report 
[Demo Video](https://youtu.be/wqiolzAXRUc)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * We now have a calendar display that can be navigated.
 * We have a Workout Form entry that supports any number of exercises.
 * We have a Nutrition Form entry that supports any number of meals.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Our first accomplishment of Sprint One was introducing our new members to C# and WinForms. While C# is a Microsoft product and works great with Visual Studio, it still takes time to teach the basics to someone who has never touched C# before. Additionally, all members of our group got to explore the toolbox and try new user controls. The general theme of this sprint was turning UML into actual code. While we had all our user cases and class diagrams written, we had never actually translated these into running code before. To make this easier on ourselves we took time for each Kanban board issue and talked in depth about what each developer should be creating as well as what it should look like.  Another issue was had was that the main form had to be started before we could all work on our seperate issues. The main focus of our first meeting was getting mainform done so that we could all branch off and do our own work.

## Unfinished Work
We were not able to complete the Create Goal Template issue. This is because the group member that this was assigned to had a family emergency and as such they were not able to complete this.

## Completed Issues/User Stories

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * [Issue 4](https://github.com/calebh13/fitness-tracker-app/issues/4) We began work on this, but the group member that this was assigned to had a family emergency.

## Code Files for Review

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We got the initial setup of the main form going quickly, due to in-person collaboration. The most helpful thing we did by far was working in-person so we could easily communicate, demonstrate code, and troubleshoot issues. This increased our productivity significantly.
  * We worked well together, and did not have major disagreements. The team lead was good at assigning responsibilities so that all tasks were completed, and we did not have more than one person working on the same thing (i.e., there were minimal merge conflicts).
  * Our usage of GitHub was relatively streamlined due to our extensive prior experience, and the Visual Studio integration. Our choice of technology, as mentioned in the Partial Project Report, helped us significantly as all tools were very well-integrated. We used almost entirely Microsoft products, and staying in their ecosystem allowed for seamless collaboration.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Sometimes, our team member deadlines were not very clearly communicated, and this led to some conflict when it came time to end the sprint and merge features.
   * Our productivity was negatively impacted by spring break. We were not able to meet, and we had familial obligations that decreased our availability for project work. This led to some crunch time at the end of the sprint when it came time to finish the project.
   * Our communication over spring break was not frequent, and this led to some confusions and as aforementioned, decreased productivity.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * We will be more clear about deadlines and expectations to ensure all tasks are properly completed. We will also communicate about any issues encountered, and if this will result in a later completion date.
   * Since there will be no more breaks, this problem will hopefully be avoided. However, obligations from other classes will begin to ramp up as we near the end of the semester. This will be addressed by continuous reminders and check-ins on features throughout sprint 2.
   * We will be in classes with each other for the rest of the year, and will be able to more frequently communicate and have in-person meetings this way.
